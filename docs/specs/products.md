TODO: allow users to create a temporary custom product, for items that aren't on the list

# Products specification
Version: 0.1-draft (2017-08-87)

This document describes the basics of products models Barbapappa uses.
It is technical and intended for developers.

## Product
A product defines something that can be bought in a bar.
The product defines the name, the prices in different currencies and availability

There are normal products, which are added by authorized users in a community.
These product can then be made available in a bar, so users can buy them.
The products are generally static, and available at all times.

Custom products are used in special cases.
Users generally have the ability to create custom products for a transaction.
This is useful if the user buys something for a given price in a bar,
that isn't listed in the list of products the bar has.
The custom products are only visible by the user itself,
and can be found when looking at the transaction in detail.
Of course, authorised users inside a community will be able to view the product as well,
but it will never show up as new available product in a bar.

### Product model
- `id`: index
- `economy_id`: reference to the economy
- `user_id`: reference to the user that added this product
- `type`: type of product this is
    - 1: `normal`: a normal product added to a bar economy
    - 2: `custom`: a custom product added by a user
- `name`: base name of the product
- `product_category_id`: optional reference to a product category
- `deleted_at`: time the product was trashed at
- `created_at`: time the product was last created at
- `updated_at`: time the product was last updated at

### Product category
A category that can be assigned to products, to better organize the product structure.

Product categories are hierarchical thus a tree of categories can be made.

#### Product category model
- `id`: index
- `economy_id`: reference to the economy
- `name`: Category name
- `parent`: reference to a parent category
- `created_at`: time the category was created at
- `updated_at`: time the category was last updated at

### Product category translation
A product may have name translations, to support different languages.
Translations override the base name of the product if set.

Only one product translation should be made in each locale.

#### Product category translation model
- `id`: index
- `product_category_id`: reference to the product category
- `locale`: locale the translation is in
- `name`: product category name
- `created_at`: time the product category translation was created at
- `updated_at`: time the product category translation was last updated at

### Product offer
A product offer specifies in what bars a product is available.

An offer model overrides the default availability properties for a product,
and is used to authorized users in a community can configure specifically
in what bar a product is available.

The `bar_id` field is used to specify what bar the offer is for.
If the field is `null`, the offer is used for all bars in the community.

The `offered` property finally determines whether the offer is available,
or whether it is not.

There may only be one offer instance per product and bar combination.

#### Product offer model
- `id`: index
- `product_id`: reference to a product
- `bar_id`: optional reference to a bar
- `offered`: true if the product is offered in the given bar, false if not
- `created_at`: time the product offer was created at
- `updated_at`: time the product offer was last updated at

### Product translation
A product may have name translations, to support different languages.
Translations override the base name of the product if set.

Only one product translation should be made in each locale.

#### Product translation model
- `id`: index
- `product_id`: reference to the product
- `locale`: locale the translation is in
- `name`: product name
- `created_at`: time the product translation was created at
- `updated_at`: time the product translation was last updated at

### Product price
The product price model specifies the price properties of a product in a given currency.
A product may have multiple prices in different currencies,
so multiple product price models may be created when multiple currencies are available.

Only one price should be specified per currency.
If no price is specified for the currency, the default currency properties are used from the economy.

A product price may specify 3 different types of prices:  
- 1: `none`: no price, not buyable (disables default prices)
- 2: `specified`: the specified price in the `price` field
- 3: `convert`: automatically convert to this `currency` based on another specified price on this product

#### Product price model
- `id`: index
- `product_id`: reference to the product
- `type`: type of the price
    - 1: `none`: no price in this currency
    - 2: `specified`: price as specified
    - 3: `convert`: automatically convert the price to the selected currency when possible
- `price`: product price
- `currency`: currency identifier
- `created_at`: time the product price was created at
- `updated_at`: time the product price was last updated at

#### Custom product model
- `id`: index
- `product_id`: reference to the super product
- `price`: price of the product
- `currency`: currency identifier
- `created_at`: time the custom product was created at
- `updated_at`: time the custom product was last updated at

## Product bag
A product bag is a virtual bag or container products are stored in.

The product bag model can be attached to various other models,
to keep track of inventory or to specify the number of products that were bought.
So, a product bag may be attached to a wallet mutation, to a bar inventory and what not.

### Bag lifetime
The lifetime of a bag is inherited from the model that references the bag.
The bag should never outlive the using model, and should never become a zombie.

When a bag is used to track inventory, the bag must be deleted when the inventory is deleted for invalidated.

It is of course allowed to create an empty bag without any containing stacks.

### Bag garbage collection
Garbage collection for zombie bags isn't currently documented in this specification.
This might be added in the future to clean up zombie bags.
This task is however expensive, and might cause trouble with undocumented references to a bag.

The availability of garbage collection wouldn't mean product bags shouldn't be deleted anymore after use.

### Product bag model
- `id`: index
- `created_at`: time the bag was created at
- `updated_at`: time the bag was last updated at

### Product stack
The product bag contains stacks of products.
Each stack is for a single kind of product, which is referenced.
The quantity of the products is stored along with it.

#### Stack with a static price
Each stack contains a static `price` field, which is `null` by default.
This field may be set to specify the price of the total stack when
the stack was last updated.
The field value won't change when the price of a referenced product is changed.
This ensures that the price or cost of the stack will remain the same from the
time it was set, whether the product price might change afterwards or not.

The money field is used for wallet mutations,
as it would be used to define the price of the stack at time of making the mutation
even though the price of the actual product might change later on.
This ensures that the money balance of a transaction doesn't change later on.

#### Stacking semantics
Products of the same type should always be summed on a single stack.
Creating multiple stacks for a product is unnecessary.

However, if the same type of product is added to a bag with a different price,
two separate stacks should be used to account for that.
Or else, static price information about the products would be lost,
and the unit price for a stack would not be calculable anymore.

The unit price of a product stack can be calculated using the formula: `unit price = price / quantity`

Stacks that have a quantity of zero should be deleted from the containing bag.
This does invalidate the `created_at` time for stacks,
because it would be changed to the new date when an product of that type is added to the bag again.
Keep that in mind.

Quantities below zero are allowed.
If a product bag with stacks is used to keep track of bar inventory,
it might happen the stack reaches a quantity below zero.
This could be because the bars inventory is unbalanced,
because the quantity got poisoned by users not claiming purchases correctly,
or whatever else.

Make sure to check whether a product bag contains stacks that have a negative quantity,
if that isn't allowed in some use case. For example, when buying products.

#### Product stack model
- `id`: index
- `product_id`: reference to a product
- `quantity`: number of products in this stack
- `price`: optional total price of the products when the stack was created
- `currency`: optional currency identifier the price is in
- `created_at`: time the stack was created at
- `updated_at`: time the stack was last updated at
